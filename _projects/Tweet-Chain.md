A long chain of tweets wrote backwards through time. A "Never starting" Poem.
This was partially an experiment with the way twitter didn't show links to twitter right (pre-2014).
Now (summer 2016) twitter displays the content of the linked tweet including old tweets, so the effect is somewhat ruined.
