After noting the technical ability required to download and install tails and
the possibility that a person may be tracked at that stage I decided to create
a project that would try and make this easier for the person wanting tails. The
person wanting tails would then only have to trust the maintainer of the box
(or whoever installed and left it). The guidelines I set myself were to make it
low cost, non-suspicious hardware that and that the usage by the person wanting
tails must be painless.
