I had an exhibition coming up and my businesscards were running out, I had recently purchased a block of out of circulation money from DPRK so I made the decicion to laser cut them and hand them out when people asked about them, asking most of them for their favourite number between 0-100 this would be the last 2 digits of the ID of the note.
