A digital tribute to Peter Dreher's Glass paintings.  

posted 0:33, 4:33, 8:33, 12:33, 16:33 & 20:33 UTC on [twitter @_xs](http://twitter.com/_xs)  

the photos are of a mug placed in the center of the frame and are tweeted in near realtime, effectively making a 6fpd (frames per day) live stream. 

The idea behind this project is both to pay homage to the Glass paintings and to add to the data pool of my twitter account making something quite boring a specticle to watch as well as some noise to the data I produce otherwise. The photos are mostly all similar.
