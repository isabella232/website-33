From around December 2012 I started tweeting the phrase I am awake/I am alive. This evolved slowly (becoming fully realised in April of 2013) into a 3 phrase mantra that I tweet somewhat often. On 2016/10/30 I decided to turn this practise into a practical verification of identity using a Git repo and GPG signed commits of the readme. I believe this is both a way of storing changes in my mind over time and also as a verification that these words come from me. You can read the git over on my [github]
