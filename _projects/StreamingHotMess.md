My experiments started with [My First YouTube Downloader](https://github.com/ixt/My-First-Youtube-Downloader) which would watch the results for "My First Vlog" set for the title. I find that the majority of the videos come from children around the age of 12 mostly from the US. It's interesting to see all the lives of these people, and their different situations. It's nice to leave streaming while hanging out, some are funny, some are sad, but mostly it's just really interesting. They tend to use metaphors and phrases such as "Like, Comment, Subscribe" and using their hands to cover the lens and video cuts. Despite the claims of these videos being the first vlogs of these people, often it's not their first video nor do they have bad camera precence, it is obvious they have been raised seeing vloggers often.
