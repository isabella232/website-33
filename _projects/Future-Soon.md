Future Soon is a long term project based on recording and documenting my life with data. Some projects are included or are related in this one and as such it is hard to define when this begins and ends. Part of the original aims of the project was to create a backup of my memories in order to reupload later on in life. 

Tweet in Public was a Hack done at King's College as part of Big social data (see [Sonosocialdataism](/sonosocialdata/) for another hack and a bit more description) 

Tweets happened on the accounts [_xstream](http://twitter.com/_xstream) and [_xstats](http://twitter.com/_xstats/) aswell as my main account [_xs](http://twitter.com/_xs). _xstream featured pictures that were posted directly from a camera I wore and carried around with me, these were taken but sometimes delayed posting until internet was available. _xstats contained activity and sleep data (along with other data I could get my hand on over time). _xs at times got posts of both types posted to it but generally it wasnt recieved well and I didn't like the self censorship I was experiencing with that method. 

Videos were uploaded for a short period of time on [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/IxtliM). Originally the videos were numbered as the amount of days since future soon started but as time went on I experiemented with doing composite videos which ended up still investing and curating and thereby censoring the time I was having and therefore going against the aims of the project. 

The start of this project was as a blog, this blog is lost to the void, if you happen to find it message me so I can add it up or delete it if the memories are found not worth keeping.
