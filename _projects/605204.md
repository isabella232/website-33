60//5\204 is a project to convert wikipedia into [Haiku]. This is presented as a script that can be used to convert lists of articles on websites (specifically for wikipedia in this case).
Currently the list is set up to take the 1000 required wikipedia articles from the [Simple English Wikipedia]

The code and results are available on [GitHub] under CC-0 and the results of the wikipedia entries are available [here]
