60//5\204 is a sequel to 60//5\203 a project to make wikipedia into [Haiku]

60//5\203 was produced at Young Rewired State 2013 as a project in the Festival of code, it was manually processed pages using copy and paste into webtools and counting done by a human (for the totalling).

60//5\204 is a proper automated version with the same goals. Some changes to the process were made in the jump:

    * Less accurate Syllable counting
    * Simple Wikipedia (instead of a summarised English wikipedia)
    * Updated article list

The code and results are available on [GitHub] under CC-0 and the results of the wikipedia entries are available [here]
